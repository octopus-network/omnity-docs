# FAQ
***Question:*** Related to costs, bridging the runes to ICP cost 13 total ICP (10 ICP for the first time going through Add Runes, 3 ICP for the second time). Is 13 ICP the amount I should expect to pay in the future? Or was the second 3 ICP fee not needed?

***Answer:*** Regarding to the cost of adding the Runes permissionlessly by the users has 2 steps:
Step 1: Adding the runes into Omnity, this step costs 10 ICP, if the Rune already exists, thereâ€™s no need to pay for it.
Step 2: Allowing bridging the Runes to a specific chain costs 3 ICP. However, if this action is performed by someone else or by us, there will be no cost.
So for example, if you have added BLOCKMINER.OG to the system and want to bridge it to another chain, such as Ethereum, you only need to pay 3 ICP.
