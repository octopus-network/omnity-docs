# Next Steps and Resources

# Next Steps
1. By default, the game uses existing Runes, but it can be further upgraded to etch new Runes once the internal process is completed.
2. The game currently displays a single-Rune settlement method, but it can be upgraded to support different Runes settlements for different games.
3. Features for interacting with other exchanges can be added, such as providing liquidity on RichSwap using the generated Runes.
