# Introduction to REE

## What is REE?

REE (Runes Exchange Environment) is a decentralized execution layer for Bitcoin DeFi. It enables open and composable smart contracts to deal with Bitcoin assets directly, without relying on bridging, asset wrapping, or non-Bitcoin wallets.

Unlike traditional Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions, REE leverages Bitcoin's security and enhances programmability through fully Turing-complete smart contracts, while enabling native Bitcoin transactions and user experiences.

## Key Differences Between REE and Traditional Bitcoin L2

| Feature          | Traditional Bitcoin L2 | REE (Bridgeless)           |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Asset Handling   | Bridging/Wrapping Req. | Native Bitcoin Assets      |
| Smart Contracts  | Limited Programmability| Fully Turing-complete      |
| Signing Mechanism| Centralized/Semi-Cent. | Decentralized via ICP      |
| Wallet Comp.     | Often Requires New Wallet| Native Bitcoin Wallets   |

## Advantages of REE

REE offers significant advantages for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. For end-users, it provides a seamless experience by supporting standard Bitcoin wallets and enabling faster transactions, all underpinned by the robust security of Bitcoin combined with decentralized validation. For developers, REE presents an open-source (FOSS) and highly composable environment, allowing protocols to interact easily and share liquidity. Builders are further empowered by a powerful smart contract platform, comprehensive tooling, practical examples, and integrated mechanisms for implementing value capture strategies.
