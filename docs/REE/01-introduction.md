# REE Introduction

## What Is REE?

REE (Runes Exchange Environment) is a decentralized execution layer for bitcoin defi. It enables open and composable smart contracts to deal with bitcoin assets directly, without relying on bridging, asset wrapping, or non-bitcoin wallets.

Unlike traditional bitcoin layer 2 solutions, REE preserves bitcoinâ€™s security while enhancing programmability through turing-complete smart contracts, all while maintaining native bitcoin transactions and a seamless user experience.

## Key Differences Between REE And Traditional Bitcoin Layer 2

| Feature          | Traditional Bitcoin L2 | REE (Bridgeless)           |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Asset Handling   | Requires bridging/wrapping | Direct native Bitcoin assets |
| Smart Contracts  | Limited Programmability| Fully Turing-complete   |
| Signing Mechanism| Centralized/semi-centralized | Fully decentralized (via ICP)|
| Wallet Compatibility| Often needs new wallets| Works with native Bitcoin wallets |

## Advantages Of REE

**REE offers compelling advantages for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem.** For end-users, it delivers a seamless experience by supporting standard Bitcoin wallets and enabling faster transactions - all while maintaining Bitcoin's robust security through decentralized validation. For developers, REE provides an open-source (FOSS), highly composable environment that facilitates easy protocol interoperability and shared liquidity. Builders gain additional power through a sophisticated smart contract platform, complete with comprehensive development tools, practical implementation examples, and integrated mechanisms for implementing value capture strategies.
