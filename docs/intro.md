# Overview

Omnity API hosts a library of assets, ranging from brand sources to fundamental apis for app developers to plug and play into their codebases.

See the **[codebase](https://github.com/octopus-network/omnity-interoperability)** for more details. 

This library consists of 2 sessions:

- [EVM](https://omnity-docs.vercel.app/docs/evm) The evm route includes layer2 evm-compatible instances.
